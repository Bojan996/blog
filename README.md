# blog

This is also one of my first projects, recently I have been browsing and found it on the goorm IDE. 
I decided to share it in order to keep track of my progress as time passed: https://blooming-plains-02321.herokuapp.com/blogs

The application is a blog, it doesnâ€™t have authentication, it allows the user to post news, interesting articles, hobbies, etc.. 
The user can also edit and delete the post once its posted. 
This was a good exercise when it comes to route handling and mongoDB management, also JavaScript logic and the basics of express.

Enjoy!
